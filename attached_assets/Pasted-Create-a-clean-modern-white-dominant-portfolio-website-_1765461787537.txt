Use the Grow Captain color palette:
– Dark Grey (#555 or similar)

Ensure the UI is minimal, premium, extremely spacious, and highly readable. The logo already exists — do NOT generate a new logo.

Design Requirements:
– Full white background across the entire site
– Minimal rounded typography
– Plenty of white spacing
– Subtle orange arrow motifs for growth
– Purple for section headings
– Grey for body text
